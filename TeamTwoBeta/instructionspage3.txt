Game Play:

When the game starts, Peppermint begins to jump. When he 
lands on the platform with the correct answer, the platform 
turns green and the problem resets. If the wrong answer is 
chosen, the platform turns red and you are given another 
chance to bounce Peppermint to the right answer. It is also 
possible to bounce off the ground as many times as necessary.
